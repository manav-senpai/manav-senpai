## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm Manav, currently sharpening my skills in web development (front-end and soon full stack!). I love blending my passion for coding with my knack for designing — not just digital, but also hardware and electronics. Whether it’s building websites or crafting gadgets, I thrive on creating things that are both useful and fun.

I’m always curious about new tech, and you’ll often find me experimenting with Python for AI/ML, tinkering with electronics, or sketching out new ideas. I also make content for YouTube and love sharing what I learn!
